## ⏱ Execution Notes
- All orders to be placed at **market open, Aug 18, 2025 (Monday)**.  
- **Sell orders (ACTU, ESPR)** should free funds before buys trigger.  
- If sells fail (e.g., gap down below limits and no recovery), buys won’t execute due to insufficient cash.  
- In that case: **reassess** (adjust limit or skip purchase).
