# Portfolio Moves at a Glance

_Date: August 30, 2025_

## Keep / No Change
- `ABEO` — hold 4 shares; stop $6.00. Thesis intact: gene therapy launch progressing; company well-capitalized. Already in profit; waiting for commercialization milestones.
- `AXGN` — hold 2 shares; stop raised to $13.00 (from $12.00). Despite FDA delay, fundamentals (revenue growth, approaching profitability) support holding through **Dec 5 PDUFA**; tighter stop manages risk during the wait.

## Add to Existing Position
- `ATYR` — buy +3 (to 11 total); stop $4.20. High conviction in efzofitimod Phase 3 potential; now the largest holding (~$59). Positive setup (completed enrollment, strong scientific rationale, limited competition). Size remains modest and acknowledges gap risk.

## Exit / Trim Positions
- `IINN` — sell 10 (exit). Catalyst ($22.5M order) realized; momentum faded; dilution risk. Redeploy ~\$11 to higher-impact ideas (ATYR, FBIO).

## Initiate New Position
- `FBIO` — buy 4 @ $2.58; stop $2.00. Near-term catalyst: **Sept 30** FDA decision on CUTX-101 (potential PRV worth ~$100M+), which could drive a re-rating. Diversified assets cushion downside vs. single-asset risk. ($10, ~7–8% of portfolio); liquidity adequate (avg volume >300K).

## Notes
- No other new positions added. `OKYO` and `GENK` were considered but not added due to timing and cash constraints.
